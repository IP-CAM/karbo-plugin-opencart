## Payment service settings
For the plugin to work, you need an active service to perform payment transactions. We will be the first to consider a payment service from KRB developers, as it is suitable for solving the problem as the most convenient and fast. It is extremely easy to use. All you have to do is go to the website of the service, create a new wallet and carefully record all the data of your wallet. You should also pay attention to the fact that this service does not offer full-fledged wallets, so to access the funds you need to install the appropriate keys in your wallet program. Only in this case it will be possible to dispose of the funds received for the order.
You can use the conservative and more classic Simplewallet wallet by running it in service mode. It will require an active and accessible cryptocurrency node KRB, as well as a computer with a network connection or a remote server to host the wallet service.

## Plugin installation
The current version of the plugin is very easy to install. To do this, unzip the extension distribution to the store's root directory. Next, go to the section with applications, where you select the section with means of payment and find in the list "Karbo". After installation, go to the plugin settings, where we see a list of parameters. The most important are: address (address of the store wallet), host and port of the payment service. In the first parameter we specify the address of the generated wallet. If you choose to work with a payment service from the developers of KRB, then the fields with the connection settings can not be touched, because they are specified by default. Then you should enable the plugin by selecting the appropriate item. If you only want to use this form of payment for certain regions, you can customize it. If necessary, specify the desired number of confirmations (recommended range of values: 6-10).
For the payment processor to work, you need to configure CRON, specifying a line to run with a time of 5 minutes (domain must specify your own): wget -O / dev / null -q http://krb-shop.pp.ua/index.php?route= p ... carbo / cron.
